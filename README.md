# ruby_enumerable_methods
Creation of methods that mimick ruby enumerables

This project was designed to re-create the functions of some selected ruby enumerable methods.
The following are the methods created and their brief descriptions.

### my_each 
Created to function like the #each method by iterating through each element of an object such as an array and can yield to a block.

### my_each_with_index
It iterates through each element in an array or hash, and extracts the element, as well as the index and will transform both the element and its index based on the code block.

### my_select
Created to return a new array containing all elements of array for which the given block returns a true value.

### my_all?
It returns a boolean value true if all the objects in the enumerable satisfies the given condition, else it returns false.

### my_any?
It returns a boolean value if any of the object in the enumerable satisfies the given condition, else it returns false.

### my_map
It returns a new array after evaluating the block with the element as an argument.

### my_inject
It passes each element and accumulate each sequentially.

## Built With
The project was built entirely with ruby.
